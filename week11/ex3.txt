========= first output
Hello
Hello

=========
========= second output
Hello



=========

since stdout is line buffered in default at first output "Hello" repeated because 
buffer was not closed with "\n" sign so it was copied during fork
and at second output the buffer was empty when fork was called, as a result
there is no repetition
