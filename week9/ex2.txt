original sequence: 10 10 6 1 3 8 5 3 1 1 1 10 7 7 1 6 10 6 3 3
better sequence: 10 10 10 10 6 6 6 1 8 5 1 1 1 7 7 1 3 3 3 3
worst sequence: 10 6 1 7 3 8 10 6 1 7 3 5 10 10 6 1 1 1 3 3

original ratio: 1
better ratio: 1.5
worst ratio: 0.25

origial sequence was randomly builded 
so second(better) sequence has greater ratio since all the requests to each page was done before page 
was removed from the memory so thouse page almost was no shared in/out
but from the outher hand thierd(worst) sequence has less ratio comapare to the original one 
since here page was shared in/out several times and much more times then in original sequence
(since we was runout of memory right before this pahe should be hitten)

P.S.
calculations was done for page nomber = 5
all sequences are build from thouse numbers:
num - num count

1 	- 5
3 	- 4
5 	- 1
6 	- 3
7 	- 2
8 	- 1
10 	- 4

20 numbers overall
