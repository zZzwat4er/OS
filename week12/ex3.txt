depends on the file size and buffer size time required for program execution
changes a little bit but not to much.
Nevertheless, if SYNC is turned on the execution time increases a lot.
user or system execution time still pretty low but real execution time is much
higher then without SYNC, since "O_SYNC provides synchronized I/O file integrity completion, meaning
write operations will flush data and all associated metadata to the underlying hardware." and if 
buffer would no complete coping in one "write" operation it will increase execution time since 
we need to provide metadata each write operation.
